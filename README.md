# CS50 Problem Set 1 â€“ Projects

This repository contains three  C programs developed as part of [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science. 

## Contents

### 1. **Pyramid (Mario Style) â€“ Basic and Advanced**
- A simple half-pyramid pattern generator, inspired by the Mario game.
- Includes **two versions**:
  - **Pyramid Basic** â€“ Standard right-aligned pyramid using user input.
  - **Pyramid Advanced** â€“ A custom version I created by extending the original problem .

### 2. **Cash**
- A program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount of money.
- Utilizes the **Greedy Algorithm** with U.S. coin denominations.

### 3. **Credit**
- A credit card validator that checks whether a card number is valid using **Luhnâ€™s Algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ These projects represent my first step into computer science and problem solving using code. I will continue to update this repository as I complete more problem sets and personal projects.
